I think I don't need to explain how to do this.</p> <p>Second, create a file named 'welcome' without any extensions. The content of it will be displayed when someone connects to server.</p> <p><code>Welcome to my LWTP site! Hello world! Lorem ipsum etc  idontwannawriteitblahblahblah</code></p> <p>It can also be dynamic.  I did some examples in Clickteam Fusion 2.5 which contains a web server that can be controlled with events.</p> <p>We have a global value 'peerCount' that literally is a counter of people who are online right now. When the client tries to fetch the welcome text we add 1 to 'peerCount' value and respond it for user. When it disconnects using the according command,  it also sends a GET request to {server}/lwtp/disconnect, so we substract 1 from 'peerCount'</p> <p>Code (CTF2.5):</p> <pre><code>On GET request 'lwtp/welcome':\n    Add 1 to [peerCount]\n\n    Add string to response:\n    \"Welcome! There are \" + Str$(peerCount) + \" users online!\"\n\n\nOn GET request 'lwtp/disconnect'\n    Sub 1 from [peerCount]\n</code></pre> <p>What does it looks like for user:</p> <p></p> <p>Time to start your server!</p> <ul> <li><code>tps &lt;port&gt;</code> - Starts a dynamic server on selected port (leave empty for 80 which is default)</li> </ul> <p>Theoretically you can even use PHP, but I don't know how to code in it. But you can also use any HTTP server, but then your site will remain static which is freaking BORING!</p>"}]}
