# Getting started

First, you need to create a Github repository named 'lwtp'.
I think I don't need to explain how to do this.

Second, create a file named 'welcome' without any extensions.
The content of it will be displayed when someone connects to server.

```Welcome to my LWTP site!
Hello world! Lorem ipsum etc 
idontwannawriteitblahblahblah```

It can also be *dynamic*. 
I did some examples in Clickteam Fusion 2.5 which contains a web server that can be controlled with events.

We have a global value 'peerCount' that literally is a counter of people who are online right now.
When the client tries to fetch the welcome text we add 1 to 'peerCount' value and respond it for user.
When it disconnects using the according command, 
it also sends a GET request to {server}/lwtp/disconnect, so we substract 1 from 'peerCount'

Code (CTF2.5):
```
On GET request 'lwtp/welcome':
	Add 1 to [peerCount]
	
	Add string to response:
	"Welcome! There are " + Str$(peerCount) + " users online!"
	

On GET request 'lwtp/disconnect'
	Sub 1 from [peerCount]
```

What does it looks like for user:
```
Welcome! There are 2 users online!
```

Time to start your server!

* `tps <port>` - Starts a dynamic server on selected port (leave empty for 80 which is default)

Theoretically you can even use PHP, but I don't know how to code in it.
But you can also use any HTTP server, but then your site will remain static which is freaking *BORING!*
